Google Chrome is a cross-platform web browser developed by Google.
It was first released in 2008 for Microsoft Windows, and was later ported to Linux,
macOS where it is the default browser built into the OS.
The browser is also the main component of Chrome OS,
where it serves as the platform for web applications.

Most of Chrome's source code comes from Google's free and open-source software project Chromium,
but Chrome is licensed as proprietary freeware.
WebKit was the original rendering engine, but Google eventually forked it to create the Blink engine;
all Chrome variants except iOS now use Blink.
